# Configuration

Welcome to the RClone Manager configuration guide. This page covers the common configuration options and workflows shared across both Desktop and Headless versions of RClone Manager.

## Quick Start

Choose your version:

- **[Desktop Configuration](Configuration-Desktop)** - For Linux, Windows, and macOS desktop systems
- **[Headless Configuration](Configuration-Headless)** - For NAS, VPS, and server environments (web-based access)

> **Note**: Both versions share ~99% feature parity. The main difference is that Headless runs as a web server accessible via browser, while Desktop runs as a native application.
